A citation recommendation system that allows users to find relevant citations for their paper drafts. The tool is backed by [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/)'s [OpenCorpus](http://labs.semanticscholar.org/corpus/corpus/archive#) dataset (released on `2017-02-21`). 

This is a lightweight production implementation using [AllenNLP](https://allennlp.org/), and a newer, expanded version of OpenCorpus. For original experimental results and more information see the [original repository](https://github.com/allenai/citeomatic) or read [**Content-based Citation Recommendation (NAACL 2018)**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08301)
